# Keras without Keras

Deep learning has been used in a variety of applications since it was introduced. However, for those who do not know how to code, deep learning is not an available method. We propose a deep learning framework called ‘*Keras* *without* *Keras*’ so that user can use deep learning with their own data, and check the results with various options without any coding knowledge.

### 1. Objectives

* Provide NN, CNN, RNN functions according to user’s input data. 
* Make user manipulate a visual interface without any coding. Keras code is generated automatically and operated in the backend.
* Provide various options so that user can change them and compare results accordingly.

### 2. Problem

Deep learning libraries require user to handle following steps in programming languages:

* step 1) Import data and split them into training and test sets
* step 2) Build a neural network architecture
* step 3) Train a model, then test it
* step 4) Check results, change options 
* step 5) Go back to step (2) <br>
→ *If you don’t know how to write programs, you can’t use deep learning!*

**Research question:** can we use neural networks including CNN and RNN without knowing how to write a program?

### 3. Architecture

***Frontend***
* *Data upload page (html, js, python)*: receive user’s data (tabular, image, text), and decide a network type (DNN, CNN, RNN)
* *Data selection page (html, js, python)*: allow user to retrieve saved data to run again
* *Build a net page (typescript)*: allow user to decide hyper-params, neural net architecture, and pass them to backend

***Backend***
* Generate a Keras code according to inputs (python)
* Train the network to generate the model
* Save the model to disk
* Send results to frontend

### 5. How to run (with shell scripts)
1. Open a terminal: `./initial.sh`
2. Start backend: `./backend.sh`
3. Open a new terminal and start frontend: `./frontend.sh`
4. Open a browser and go to: `http://0.0.0.0:3333/`

### 6. How to run (w/o shell scripts)
1. Initialize the SQlite database: `python init_database.py`
2. Install all dependencies
 - `sudo pip install -U Flask`
 - `sudo apt-get install python3`
 - `pip install pandas`
 - `sudo pip install keras`
 - `sudo pip install tensorflow`
 - `sudo pip install scikit-learn`
 - `sudo pip install -U flask-cors`
 - `cd playground` & `sudo npm i` & `sudo npm run build` & `cd ..`

3. Run the Flask Backend Server
 - To start the server: `python3 app.py`
 - Optional Step: If you want to CURL on the models, run: `python request.py` (Comment out the request that you don't want to test)

4. Run the Node Frontend Server
 - Open a new terminal and go to playground: `cd playground`
 - To start the frontend server: `npm run serve`

5. Use some example data for uploading/running test:
 - tabular data: data/data_new.csv (for classification)
 - image data: data/mnist21x21_3789_one_hot.pklz (for image classification)
 - text data: data/asyoulikeit.txt (for language modeling)

6. Open a browser and go to: `http://0.0.0.0:3333/`
